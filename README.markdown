# What is it?

Labrepl is an environment for exploring the Clojure language. It
includes:

* a web application that presents a set of lab exercises with
  step-by-step instructions
* an interactive repl for working with the lab exercises
* solutions with passing tests 
* up-to-date versions of Clojure, contrib, incanter, compojure and a bunch of other libraries to explore

See instructions below for getting started with NetBeans/Enclojure, Eclipse/Counterclockwise, Maven, Mac/Linux command line, Windows command line, IDEA/La Clojure, and Emacs.

## Getting Started (NetBeans with the Enclojure plugin)

This is a one-time setup that does not require the git command line, Maven, or leiningen.

* Install the Java SE version of [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html)
* Launch NetBeans
* If you've just installed NetBeans for the first time, make sure the Java SE plugin is
active
  * Click the "Install Plugins" link on the Start page, then select the "Installed" tab or...
  * Go to the Tools > Plugins menu, then select the "Installed" tab
* Download the [git plugin](http://nbgit.googlecode.com/files/nbgit-0.3.nbm)
* Download the [Enclojure plugin](http://github.com/downloads/EricThorsen/enclojure/enclojure-plugin-2010-23-mar.nbm)
* Install the git and Enclojure plugins
  * Go to the Tools > Plugins menu, then select the "Downloaded" tab
  * Click the "Add Plugins..." button and locate the downloaded .nbms files
  * Click the "Install" button to complete the installation
* Restart NetBeans with the git and Enclojure plugins installed
* Clone the labrepl project from GitHub
  * Go to the Team > Git > Clone Other menu
  * For the Repository URL, use git://github.com/relevance/labrepl
  * Choose an arbitrary Parent Directory location where NetBeans will clone laprepl   
* Open the labrepl project
  * Use the File > Open Project menu and select the directory where you cloned labrepl
* Right click on "Libraries" in the project pane and select "Download Missing Dependencies"
  * Wait for that to complete

To run the labrepl:

1. Right click on the project in the project pane and select "Start Project REPL" (near the bottom)
2. In the integrated REPL window, type:
  * `(require 'labrepl)`
  * `(labrepl/-main)`
3. Browse to http://localhost:8080
4. Enjoy the labs!

## Getting Started (Eclipse/Counterclockwise)

This is a one-time setup that does not require the git command line, Maven, or leiningen.

* If you do not have Eclipse installed
  * Grab a recent version of eclipse, e.g. the "Eclipse IDE for java developers" from the download page: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
  * Unzip it somewhere. The executable is eclipse (linux) eclipse.exe (windows) located in the eclipse/ directory created by the unzip operation
  * The first time it is run, it will ask you for a location on your disk where eclipse will put its metadata and will create new projects by default.
* If you do not have Eclipse Git (EGit) installed
  * You install it via the "software update center", that is:
  * Menu Help > Install new software...
  * Paste the following EGit url in the "Work with:" textbox: http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates
  * Hit Enter
  * Select "Eclipse EGit feature", verify the "Contact all update sites during ..." chekbox is checked, click next, accept licence, etc., restart Eclipse
* If you do not have maven support in Eclipse (plugin m2e)
  * You install it via the "software update center", that is:
  * Menu Help > Install new software...
  * Paste the following maven2eclipse (m2e) url in the "Work with:" textbox: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e
  * Hit Enter
  * Select Maven Integration for Eclipse, verify the "Contact all update sites during ..." chekbox is checked, click next, accept licence, etc., restart Eclipse
* If you do not have Counterclockwise installed
  * You install it via the "software update center", that is:
  * Menu Help > Install new software...
  * Paste the following Counterclockwise url in the "Work with:" textbox: http://updatesite.counterclockwise.googlecode.com/hg/
  * Hit Enter
  * Select counterclockwise, verify the "Contact all update sites during ..." chekbox is checked, click next, accept licence, etc., restart Eclipse
* Grab labrepl from git via EGit
  * Menu File > Import ... > Git > Git Repository ; Hit Next
  * URI: git://github.com/relevance/labrepl.git ; Hit Next ; Hit Next ; Uncheck "Import Existing Projects"; Hit Finish
* Import the maven project into Eclipse
  * Menu File > Import ... > Maven > Existing Maven Projects ; Hit Next
  * Choose root directory (wherever you dropped the labrepl in the previous step); Hit Finish
* Enable Clojure Support
  * Right-click the "labrepl" project in Package Explorer and choose "Enable/disable Clojure language support"  

To run the labrepl

* Right click on project "labrepl" in the Package Explorer
  * Run as > Clojure REPL
* In the REPL Console:
  * `(require 'labrepl)`
  * `(labrepl/-main)`
* Browse to localhost:8080
* Enjoy the labs!

## Getting Started (IDEA/La Clojure)

One-time setup

* Install [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). The free Community Edition works fine.
* Install the La Clojure plugin:
  * Prefereneces/Plugins/Available, select La Clojure, right click
and download the plugin.
* Restart IDEA.
* Clone the labrepl repository:
  * Choose Version Control|Checkout From Version Control|Git. Fill in the dialog with:
      * Repository URL: git://github.com/relevance/labrepl.git
      * Leave Origin Name blank
      * Choose whatever Parent Directory you want
      * Directory name: labrepl
  * Choose "Yes" for create IDEA project, and then:
      * Import Project from external model
      * Choose Maven if given choice of models
      * Accept all the defaults (click "Next" a bunch of times.)
  * Wait for maven to download dependencies.

To run the labrepl

* Choose Tools|Clojure REPL|Add new Clojure REPL
* In the REPL Console
  * `(require 'labrepl)`
  * `(labrepl/-main)`
* Browse to localhost:8080
* Enjoy the labs!

## Getting Started (Maven)

* Make sure you have Java installed.
* Make sure you have Maven (http://maven.apache.org/) installed.
* Run `mvn clojure:repl` to launch Clojure REPL (maven will download all necessary
  dependencies).
* Browse to localhost:8080 for instructions.
* Press Ctrl+D to exit the repl when you are done.

## Getting Started (Mac/Linux command line) 

* Make sure you have Java installed.
* Make sure you have leiningen installed (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).
* Run `lein deps` to install dependent libs.
* Run `script/repl` to launch the labrepl.
* Browse to localhost:8080 for instructions.
* Press Ctrl+D to exit the repl when you are done.

## Getting Started (Windows command line)

This is minimally tested. You are probably better off using Maven or one of the IDEs above. Let me know if you have problems.

* Make sure you have Java installed.
* Make sure you have leiningen installed (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). Do not use `lein self-install` as Windows installation is a manual process. You will need to:
* Download leinigen.jar and set `LEIN_JAR` to point to it.
* Download a Clojure 1.1 clojure.jar (from clojure.org) and set `CLOJURE_JAR` to point to it.
* Set your path to include `{your-lein-install}\bin`
* Run `lein.bat deps` to install dependent libs
* Run `script\repl` to launch the labrepl.
* Browse to localhost:8080 for instructions.
* Press Ctrl+D to exit the repl when you are done.

## Getting Started (Emacs)

If you don't know emacs you may want to pick one of the choices above. The learning curve is steep.

* Install Emacs, the Emacs Starter Kit, Clojure mode, slime, and swank.
* From within emacs, set the `inferior-lisp-program` variable to `script/swank`. 
* Making sure your emacs working directory is the labrepl, run `inferior-lisp`.
* If you want slime as well, run `slime-connect` and accept the defaults. You now have slime and inferior-lisp both working simultaneously.

## Running the Tests

* Maven: `mvn clojure:test`
* Shell: `script/test`
